Decentralized Skill Verification Network

A blockchain-based platform for transparent, immutable, and decentralized skill verification. Unlike traditional resumes or centralized platforms, this network leverages Solidity smart contracts on the Ethereum-compatible blockchain to ensure that skill endorsements are authentic and tamper-proof.

📌 Project Vision

Our vision is to revolutionize how skills are authenticated in the digital age. Instead of relying on subjective claims or centralized authorities, we provide cryptographic proof of expertise that is globally accessible.

With this system:

Individuals own their professional identity.

Employers can confidently assess verified skills.

Trust & transparency become the foundation of professional networking.

🚀 Key Features

On-chain User Profiles
Store personal details (e.g., name, university) directly on the blockchain.

Skill Addition
Add and describe new skills with an immutable timestamp.

Skill Verification

Verified by peers, colleagues, or employers.

Prevents self-verification.

Prevents duplicate verification from the same address.

Revocation of Skills
Skill owners can remove skills from their profile.

Verifier Tracking
Every verification stores the verifier’s address, ensuring transparency.

Detailed Skill Data
Each skill includes timestamps for creation and last verification.

🔮 Future Scope

UI/UX Development – Build a decentralized application (dApp) for seamless interaction.

Skill Categories & Tags – Organize skills into domains (e.g., Programming, Design, Management).

Reputation System – Introduce reputation scores weighted by high-reputation verifiers.

NFT Integration – Skill-based NFTs as verifiable certificates of expertise.

API Integrations – Enable professional platforms to integrate the verification network.

Gas Optimization – Reduce transaction costs for wider adoption.
